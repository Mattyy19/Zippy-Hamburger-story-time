<<<<<<< HEAD
I went to the Baeckerei and stole some Gebaeck and one loaf of Brot.
The Brot was not fulfilling though, so I decided to go visit a garden.
After going to the garden, it was decided that it would be best to head to
the Flughafen and get a high quality bratwurst and klimaanlage.
The klimaanlage at the Flughafen went out right as I arrived, and the Hund looked at me scared with horror eyes.
