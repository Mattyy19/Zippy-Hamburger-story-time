I went to the Baeckerei and stole some Gebaeck and one loaf of Brot.
The Brot was not fulfilling though, so I decided to go visit a garden.
After going to the garden, it was decided that it would be best to head to
the Flughafen and get a high quality bratwurst and klimaanlage.
The klimaanlage at the Flughafen went out right as I arrived, and the Hund looked at me scared with horror eyes.

After eating, I decided to join a competition, a squid competition.
I tend to get really wettbewerbsfaehig, so the whole city had to schloss me in my own house to prevent me from participating in the Squid Games.

After successfully winning the squid games, I won enough money to buy a BMW.
I pulled up to the Biergarten in my BMW, wearing a Lederhose.
As I went to schloss my BMW, there to greet me stood none other than the infamous and talented biergarten hund.
I overreacted with joy to greet the infamous and talented biergarten Hund, who was wearing a dirndel and carrying brot.
Unfortunately for me the biergarten hund was not greeting me, he just wanted the gebaeck hiding in my back pocket. 
With this realizatoin, I began ran across the Hauptstrasse to get away, but the hund followed me anyways.
