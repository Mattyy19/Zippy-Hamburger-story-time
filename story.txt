Peering into the Baeckerei, I saw a woman and held in her hand, was an Apfelkuchen fresh out the BÃ¤ckerei.
I then went inside the Baeckerei and stole some Gebaeck and one loaf of Brot.
The Brot was not fulfilling though, so I decided to go visit a garden.
After going to the garden, it was decided that it would be best to head to
the Flughafen and get a high quality bratwurst and klimaanlage.
The klimaanlage at the Flughafen went out right as I arrived, and the Hund looked at me scared with horror eyes.

After eating, I decided to join a competition, a squid competition.
I tend to get really wettbewerbsfaehig, so the whole city had to schloss me in my own house to prevent me from participating in the Squid Games.

After successfully winning the squid games, I won enough money to buy a BMW.
I pulled up to the Biergarten in my BMW, wearing a Lederhose.


As I went to schloss my BMW, there to greet me stood none other than the infamous and talented biergarten hund. 
He stared at me almost like he was asking me for something.

I figured, the hund must be hungry, I looked around and attempted to give it a bratwurst from a nearby table.
(Although I was still in the biergarten and eating the apfelkuchen and brot that I ordered from the baeckerie, 
I did NOT want to share this with the hund.
Joyfully I greeted the infamous and talented biergarten Hund, who was wearing a dirndel and 
now devouring the piece of bratwurst that I threw it.

Unfortunately for me the biergarten hund was not greeting me, he just wanted the gebaeck hiding in my back pocket. 
With this realizatoin, I began ran across the Hauptstrasse to get away, but the hund followed me anyways.

The hund followed me all the way to the Baeckerei and I decided to feed it some Gebaeck while we were there.
Suddenly the Hund dropped the Gebaeck from its mouth, offering me a snack.
